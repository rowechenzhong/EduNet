# Explanation of Basic Dense Neural Network Layer Implementation

This code defines a basic implementation of a Dense neural network layer using Python and NumPy. A Dense layer is a fundamental component of a neural network where each neuron (or node) in the layer is connected to all neurons in the previous layer. The code defines various methods and attributes that together allow this layer to perform forward and backward propagation, which are the core operations of training a neural network.

## Import Statements:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit
```

-   `numpy`: A library for numerical operations in Python.
-   `scipy.special.expit`: A function to compute the sigmoid function.

## Activation Functions:

```python
def softmax(x):
    return np.exp(x - np.max(x)) / np.exp(x - np.max(x)).sum()
```

-   `softmax(x)`: A function to compute the softmax activation function. Softmax is used for multi-class classification problems to convert raw scores into a probability distribution.

## Dense Class:

```python
class Dense(Layer):
    def __init__(self, o_size: int, i_size: int = -1, activation: str = "none", eta: float = 0.01):
        super().__init__()

        # ... (constructor code)

    def update_input(self, i_size):
        # ... (update_input method code)

    def propagate(self, A):
        # ... (propagate method code)

    def dAdZ(self, dLdA):
        # ... (dAdZ method code)

    def backpropagate(self, dLdA):
        # ... (backpropagate method code)
```

-   The `Dense` class inherits from a class called `Layer`, implying it's meant to be part of a larger neural network.
-   It is initialized with parameters such as `o_size` (number of neurons in this layer), `i_size` (number of input features), `activation` (activation function), and `eta` (learning rate).
-   Methods like `update_input`, `propagate`, `dAdZ`, and `backpropagate` implement the required components of any `Layer`. They perform various steps in forward and backward propagation.

## Activation Functions in Methods:

```python
    def propagate(self, A):
        # ... (other code)

        if self.f == "relu":
            self.Aout = np.maximum(0, self.Z)
        elif self.f == "softmax":
            self.Aout = softmax(self.Z)
        elif self.f == "sigmoid":
            self.Aout = expit(self.Z)
        elif self.f == "none":
            self.Aout = self.Z
        else:
            self.Aout = self.Z
        return self.Aout

    def dAdZ(self, dLdA):
        # ... (other code)

        if self.f == "relu":
            dLdZ = np.diagflat(np.heaviside(self.Z, 0.5))
        elif self.f == "softmax":
            # ... (softmax derivative computation)
        elif self.f == "sigmoid":
            dLdZ = (self.Aout * (1 - self.Aout)) * dLdA
        elif self.f == "none":
            dLdZ = dLdA
        else:
            dLdZ = dLdA
        return dLdZ
```

-   The activation function is used as a nonlinearity to compute the output of the layer (`Aout`).
-   During backpropagation, the derivative of the activation function is used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input (`dLdZ`).
-   For ReLU, softmax, and sigmoid activations, appropriate computations are performed.
-   For "none", the output remains unchanged.

## Backpropagation:

```python
    def backpropagate(self, dLdA):
        dLdZ = self.dLdZ(dLdA)

        dLdW = np.matmul(self.A, dLdZ.T)
        dLdW0 = dLdZ

        self.W -= self.eta * dLdW
        self.W0 -= self.eta * dLdW0

        dLdA = np.matmul(self.W, dLdZ)

        return dLdA
```

-   Gradients with respect to weights and biases (`dLdW` and `dLdW0`) are calculated using the chain rule.
-   Weights and biases are updated using the gradients and the learning rate.
-   The gradient with respect to the input (`dLdA`) is computed for further backpropagation.

Remember that this code is part of a larger neural network framework, where you would have more components like loss functions, optimizers, and other layer types to build and train a neural network for various tasks like classification or regression.
