In my freshman year at MIT, I wanted to take 6.036 machine learning, but didn't have enough credits. So I learned it myself. Then, to make sure I understood everything, I implemented all the major components of a neural network from scratch.

Later, I came back and supplemented the code with some commentary, features, and a few tutorials. If you're trying to use this as a resource, a good starting place might be the [Basic Dense Layer](Dense/Basic.md), the [Tutorial for its implementation](Dense/Basic-Implementation.md), and the accompanying [Source Code](Dense/Basic.py).
